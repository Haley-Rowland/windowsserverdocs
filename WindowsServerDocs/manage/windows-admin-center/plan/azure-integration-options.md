# What Azure integration options are there with Windows Admin Center?

>Applies To: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview

Windows Admin center was built with the cloud in mind - that means Azure integration is built in to help you leverage Azure resources from your servers, whether they're on-premises or in the cloud. Although Windows Admin Center has no Azure dependencies or requirements and doesn't require internet connectivity for deployment, you can optionally add integration with the Azure services described below.

## Azure Active Directory authentication
You can add an additional layer of security to Windows Admin Center by requiring users to authenticate using [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) identities to access the gateway. Azure AD authentication also lets you take advantage of Azure AD’s security features like conditional access and multi-factor authentication.

## Manage Azure IaaS virtual machines
You can use Windows Admin Center to manage your Azure VMs as well as on-premises machines. By configuring your Windows Admin Center gateway to have connectivity to your Azure VNet, you can manage virtual machines in Azure using the consistent, simplified tools Windows Admin Center provides.

## Protect your Hyper-V virtual machines with Azure Site Recovery
[Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview) is an Azure service that replicates workloads running on VMs so that your business-critical infrastructure is protected in case of a disaster. Windows Admin Center streamlines setup and the process of replicating your virtual machines on your Hyper-V servers or clusters, making it easy to bolster the resiliency of your environment with Azure Site Recovery’s disaster recovery service.

## Centrally manage operating system updates for all your Windows Servers with Azure Update Management
[Azure Update Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-update-management) is a solution in Azure Automation that allows you to manage updates and patches for multiple machines from a single place, rather than on a per-server basis. With Azure Update Management, you can quickly assess the status of available updates, schedule installation of required updates, and review deployment results to verify updates that apply successfully. This is possible whether your machines are Azure VMs, hosted by other cloud providers, or on premise.

## Azure Network Adapter (Preview)

In the network tool, you’ll find the option to add an Azure Network Adapter. This is a virtual NIC that will help you securely connect your local computer to an Azure Virtual Network.
